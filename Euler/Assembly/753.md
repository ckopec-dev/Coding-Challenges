# Euler Problem 753 Solution in Assembly

I'll solve Euler Problem 753, which asks for the sum of all positive integers n ≤ 10^16 such that φ(n) = φ(n+1) = φ(n+2), where φ is Euler's totient function.

## Problem Understanding

We need to find numbers n where three consecutive integers have the same totient value. This is a very challenging problem that requires:
- Efficient computation of Euler's totient function
- Finding patterns in totient values
- Handling large numbers (up to 10^16)

mathematical_approach:
