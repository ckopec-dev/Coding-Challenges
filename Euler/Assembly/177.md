# Euler Problem 177 Solution in Assembly

I'll solve this step-by-step, but first let me clarify what Euler Problem 177 asks for:

**Problem Statement**: 
A square lamina is formed by cutting out a square of side length `k` from a square of side length `n`, where `k < n`. We want to count how many different square laminae can be formed with a perimeter of exactly 100,000 units.

## Analysis
For a square lamina with outer square of side `n` and inner square of side `k`:
- Perimeter = 4n + 4k = 4(n + k) = 100,000
- Therefore: n + k = 25,000
- Since k < n, we have 0 < k < n and n + k = 25,000

This means for each valid k, we get n = 25,000 - k, where 0 < k < (25,000 - k), which simplifies to k < 12,500.

## Assembly Implementation

```assembly
.section .data
    target_perimeter:   .long 100000
    half_perimeter:     .long 50000
    max_k:              .long 12499
    
.section .text
    .global _start
    
_start:
    # Initialize registers
    movl $0, %eax          # count = 0
    movl $1, %ebx          # k = 1 (starting value)
    movl max_k, %ecx       # max_k for loop condition
    
loop_start:
    # Check if k < max_k
    cmpl %ecx, %ebx
    jge loop_end
    
    # Calculate n = half_perimeter - k
    movl half_perimeter, %edx
    subl %ebx, %edx        # n = 50000 - k
    
    # Check if k < n (k < 50000 - k)
    # This is equivalent to 2*k < 50000, or k < 25000
    # Since we already checked k < 12499, this is automatically satisfied
    
    # Valid lamina found, increment count
    incl %eax              # count++
    
    # Increment k
    incl %ebx              # k++
    jmp loop_start
    
loop_end:
    # Result is in %eax
    # Exit program
    movl $1, %eax          # sys_exit
    movl $0, %ebx          # exit status
    int $0x80

# Alternative optimized version using bit manipulation
optimized_version:
    # Since k ranges from 1 to 12499 (inclusive)
    # The count is simply 12499
    movl $12499, %eax      # Direct result
    
    # Exit program
    movl $1, %eax          # sys_exit
    movl $0, %ebx          # exit status
    int $0x80
```

## Explanation of the Solution

### Mathematical Analysis:
1. **Perimeter constraint**: 4(n + k) = 100,000 → n + k = 25,000
2. **Geometric constraint**: k < n (since we need a proper lamina)
3. **Combining constraints**: 
   - n + k = 25,000
   - k < n
   - Therefore: k < 25,000/2 = 12,500
4. **Valid range**: 1 ≤ k ≤ 12,499

### Assembly Implementation Details:

1. **Register Usage**:
   - `%eax`: Counter for valid laminae
   - `%ebx`: Current value of k (loop variable)
   - `%ecx`: Maximum k value (12,499)
   - `%edx`: Temporary storage for calculations

2. **Algorithm Steps**:
   - Initialize counter to 0
   - Start with k = 1
   - For each valid k < 12,500:
     - Calculate n = 25,000 - k
     - Increment counter (since all values are valid)
   - Continue until k reaches 12,499

3. **Optimization**:
   - Since we know the mathematical result is simply 12,499
   - The direct computation version (`optimized_version`) is more efficient

### Final Answer:
The number of different square laminae with a perimeter of exactly 100,000 units is **12,499**.

This represents all valid combinations where k ranges from 1 to 12,499, and for each k, n = 25,000 - k satisfies the constraints.
