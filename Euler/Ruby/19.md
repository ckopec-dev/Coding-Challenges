# Euler Problem 19 Solution in Ruby

## Problem Statement
You are given the following information, but you should try to solve it yourself first!

- 1 Jan 1900 was a Monday.
- Thirty days has September, April, June and November.
- All the rest have thirty-one,
- Saving February alone, which has twenty-eight, rain or shine.
- And on leap years, twenty-nine.
- A leap year occurs on any year evenly divisible by 4, but not on a century unless it is divisible by 400.

How many Sundays fell on the first of the month during the twentieth century (1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000)?

## Solution

```ruby
def is_leap_year(year)
  (year % 4 == 0) && (year % 100 != 0 || year % 400 == 0)
end

def days_in_month(month, year)
  case month
  when 4, 6, 9, 11
    30
  when 2
    is_leap_year(year) ? 29 : 28
  else
    31
  end
end

# Start from 1 Jan 1900 (Monday = 0, Sunday = 6)
day_of_week = 0  # Monday
sunday_count = 0

# Iterate through years 1900 to 2000
(1900..2000).each do |year|
  (1..12).each do |month|
    # Check if this is a Sunday and first day of month (and year is 1901 or later)
    if year > 1900 && day_of_week == 6
      sunday_count += 1
    end
    
    # Move to next month
    day_of_week = (day_of_week + days_in_month(month, year)) % 7
  end
end

puts sunday_count
```

## Alternative Solution (More Readable)

```ruby
# Using Ruby's built-in Date class for cleaner code
require 'date'

count = 0
# Iterate through each month from 1901 to 2000
(1901..2000).each do |year|
  (1..12).each do |month|
    # Check if the first day of the month is a Sunday
    if Date.new(year, month, 1).wday == 0
      count += 1
    end
  end
end

puts count
```

## Answer
The number of Sundays that fell on the first of the month during the twentieth century is **171**.

The solution works by:
1. Tracking the day of the week as we move through each month
2. Counting when the first day of a month falls on a Sunday (day 6 in 0-6 indexing)
3. Only counting from 1901 onwards (as specified in the problem)
4. Properly handling leap years and month lengths

The second solution using Ruby's Date class is more concise and readable, while the first solution demonstrates the mathematical approach of manually tracking day progression.
