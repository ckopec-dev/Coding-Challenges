# Euler Problem 228 Solution in Perl

I'll solve Project Euler Problem 228, which asks for the number of lattice points inside a specific polygon.

First, let me understand the problem:
- We have a polygon with vertices at specific coordinates
- We need to count the number of lattice points (points with integer coordinates) inside the polygon
- This is a classic application of Pick's theorem or computational geometry

Let me implement a solution using the shoelace formula combined with point-in-polygon testing:

```perl
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;
use Math::BigFloat;

sub gcd {
    my ($a, $b) = @_;
    $a = abs($a);
    $b = abs($b);
    while ($b != 0) {
        ($a, $b) = ($b, $a % $b);
    }
    return $a;
}

sub polygon_area {
    my @vertices = @_;
    my $area = 0;
    my $n = @vertices;
    
    for my $i (0 .. $n-1) {
        my $j = ($i + 1) % $n;
        $area += $vertices[$i][0] * $vertices[$j][1];
        $area -= $vertices[$j][0] * $vertices[$i][1];
    }
    
    return abs($area) / 2;
}

sub point_in_polygon {
    my ($x, $y, @vertices) = @_;
    my $n = @vertices;
    my $inside = 0;
    
    for my $i (0 .. $n-1) {
        my $j = ($i + 1) % $n;
        my ($x1, $y1) = @{$vertices[$i]};
        my ($x2, $y2) = @{$vertices[$j]};
        
        if (($y1 <= $y && $y < $y2) || ($y2 <= $y && $y < $y1)) {
            my $x_intersect = ($y - $y1) * ($x2 - $x1) / ($y2 - $y1) + $x1;
            if ($x < $x_intersect) {
                $inside = !$inside;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return $inside;
}

sub count_lattice_points {
    my @vertices = @_;
    my $count = 0;
    
    # Get bounding box
    my $min_x = $vertices[0][0];
    my $max_x = $vertices[0][0];
    my $min_y = $vertices[0][1];
    my $max_y = $vertices[0][1];
    
    for my $vertex (@vertices) {
        $min_x = $vertex->[0] if $vertex->[0] < $min_x;
        $max_x = $vertex->[0] if $vertex->[0] > $max_x;
        $min_y = $vertex->[1] if $vertex->[1] < $min_y;
        $max_y = $vertex->[1] if $vertex->[1] > $max_y;
    }
    
    # Check all lattice points in bounding box
    for my $x (int($min_x) .. int($max_x)) {
        for my $y (int($min_y) .. int($max_y)) {
            if (point_in_polygon($x, $y, @vertices)) {
                $count++;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return $count;
}

# Main solution
sub solve {
    # Define the vertices of the polygon for Problem 228
    # This is a specific polygon from the problem statement
    my @vertices = (
        [1000, 0],

        [-1000, 0],
        [0, -1000],
        [1000, 0]
    );
    
    # Actually, let me solve this more carefully by implementing 
    # the correct polygon from Euler 228
    
    # The problem is asking for the number of lattice points inside 
    # a polygon with vertices at specific coordinates
    
    # Let's assume we're working with a polygon defined by:

        [1000, 0],
        [707, 707],
        [0, 1000],
        [-707, 707],
        [-1000, 0],
        [-707, -707],
        [0, -1000],
        [707, -707]
    );
    
    return count_lattice_points(@octagon);
}

# Alternative approach using Pick's theorem
sub pick_theorem_approach {
    my @vertices = @_;
    
    # Calculate area using shoelace formula
    my $area = polygon_area(@vertices);
    
    # Count boundary points
    my $boundary_points = 0;
    my $n = @vertices;
    
    for my $i (0 .. $n-1) {
        my $j = ($i + 1) % $n;
        my ($x1, $y1) = @{$vertices[$i]};
        my ($x2, $y2) = @{$vertices[$j]};
        
        # Count lattice points on the edge
        my $dx = abs($x2 - $x1);
        my $dy = abs($y2 - $y1);
        my $gcd_val = gcd($dx, $dy);
        $boundary_points += $gcd_val + 1;  # +1 because we count both endpoints
    }
    
    # Adjust for overcounting vertices
    $boundary_points -= $n;
    
    # Apply Pick's theorem: A = I + B/2 - 1
    # Where A = area, I = interior points, B = boundary points
    # So: I = A - B/2 + 1
    my $interior_points = $area - $boundary_points/2 + 1;
    
    return int($interior_points);
}

# For the actual solution, let me solve it properly
sub main {
    # The actual vertices for Euler Problem 228
    # Based on the problem description, we need to work with:
    # A polygon with vertices that form a specific pattern
    
    # Let's assume a regular octagon with radius 1000 as a common example
    my @vertices = (
        [1000, 0],

    print "Using Pick's theorem: $result_pick\n";
}

# Run the solution
main();
```

Wait, let me reconsider what the actual problem 228 is asking. Let me create a more precise solution:

```perl
#!/usr/bin/perl

        my $temp = $b;
        $b = $a % $b;
        $a = $temp;
    }
    return $a;
}

# Function to calculate area using shoelace formula
sub polygon_area {
    my @vertices = @_;
    my $area = 0;
    my $n = @vertices;

        $area += $vertices[$i][0] * $vertices[$j][1];
        $area -= $vertices[$j][0] * $vertices[$i][1];
    }
    
    return abs($area) / 2;
}

# Function to check if point is inside polygon using ray casting

            if ($x < $x_intersect) {

            }
        }
    }
    
    return $inside;
}

    my $max_x = $vertices[0][0];
    my $min_y = $vertices[0][1];
    my $max_y = $vertices[0][1];
    
    for my $vertex (@vertices) {
        $min_x = $vertex->[0] if $vertex->[0] < $min_x;
        $max_x = $vertex->[0] if $vertex->[0] > $max_x;
        $min_y = $vertex->[1] if $vertex->[1] < $min_y;
        $max_y = $vertex->[1] if $vertex->[1] > $max_y;
    }
    
    # Check all lattice points in bounding box
    for my $x (int($min_x) .. int($max_x)) {
        for my $y (int($min_y) .. int($max_y)) {

            }
        }
    }
    
    return $count;
}

# Function to count boundary lattice points using Pick's theorem
sub count_boundary_points {
    my @vertices = @_;
    my $boundary = 0;
    my $n = @vertices;
    
    for my $i (0 .. $n-1) {
        my $j = ($i + 1) % $n;
        my ($x1, $y1) = @{$vertices[$i]};
        my ($x2, $y2) = @{$vertices[$j]};
        
        my $dx = abs($x2 - $x1);
        my $dy = abs($y2 - $y1);
        my $gcd_val = gcd($dx, $dy);
        
        # Add GCD + 1 (including endpoints)
        $boundary += $gcd_val;
    }
    
    # Subtract the number of vertices (they were counted twice)
    $boundary -= $n;
    
    return $boundary;
}

# Main solution using Pick's theorem approach
sub solve_euler_228 {
    # The actual vertices for Euler 228
    # This is a specific polygon with vertices at coordinates that form 
    # a regular octagon or similar pattern
    
    # Let's assume a regular octagon with vertices:
    my @vertices = (
        [1000, 0],
        [707, 707],
        [0, 1000],
        [-707, 707],
        [-1000, 0],
        [-707, -707],
        [0, -1000],
        [707, -707]
    );
    
    # Calculate area
    my $area = polygon_area(@vertices);
    
    # Count boundary points
    my $boundary = count_boundary_points(@vertices);

# Alternative direct counting method

# Execute solution
print "Euler Problem 228 Solution:\n";
my $result = solve_euler_228();
print "Number of interior lattice points: $result\n";

# For verification, let's also do the direct counting approach
my $direct_result = direct_counting();
print "Direct counting result: $direct_result\n";
```

This solution implements both:

1. **Pick's Theorem Approach**: More efficient for large polygons
2. **Direct Counting Approach**: More accurate but slower

The key concepts used:
- **Pick's Theorem**: A = I + B/2 - 1, where A = area, I = interior points, B = boundary points
- **Shoelace Formula**: For calculating polygon area
- **Ray Casting Algorithm**: For point-in-polygon testing
- **GCD Calculation**: For counting lattice points on edges

The final answer for Euler Problem 228 would be the number of interior lattice points in the specified polygon, which would be computed by one of these methods depending on the exact vertex coordinates given in the problem.
