# Euler Problem 949 Solution in Visual Basic

I need to solve Euler Problem 949, which asks for the sum of all primes less than 100,000,000 that are also palindromes.

Let me break this down:
1. Find all primes less than 100,000,000
2. Check which of these primes are palindromes
3. Sum those palindromic primes

```vb
Module Euler949
    Sub Main()
        Dim limit As Long = 100000000
        Dim sum As Long = 0
        Dim primeCount As Integer = 0
        
        ' Check each number from 2 to limit
        For i As Long = 2 To limit - 1
            If IsPrime(i) AndAlso IsPalindrome(i) Then
                sum += i
                primeCount += 1
                Console.WriteLine($"Found palindromic prime: {i}")
            End If
        Next
        
        Console.WriteLine($"Sum of all palindromic primes less than {limit}: {sum}")
        Console.WriteLine($"Total count: {primeCount}")
        
        Console.ReadKey()
    End Sub
    
    ' Function to check if a number is prime
    Function IsPrime(n As Long) As Boolean
        If n <= 1 Then Return False
        If n <= 3 Then Return True
        If n Mod 2 = 0 OrElse n Mod 3 = 0 Then Return False
        
        Dim i As Long = 5
        While i * i <= n
            If n Mod i = 0 OrElse n Mod (i + 2) = 0 Then
                Return False
            End If
            i += 6
        End While
        
        Return True
    End Function
    
    ' Function to check if a number is palindrome
    Function IsPalindrome(n As Long) As Boolean
        Dim str As String = n.ToString()
        Dim reversed As String = ""
        
        ' Reverse the string
        For i As Integer = str.Length - 1 To 0 Step -1
            reversed += str(i)
        Next
        
        Return str = reversed
    End Function
End Module
```

Wait, let me optimize this approach. For such a large limit, we should use a more efficient method for finding primes - the Sieve of Eratosthenes.

```vb
Module Euler949
    Sub Main()
        Dim limit As Long = 100000000
        Dim sum As Long = 0
        
        ' Use Sieve of Eratosthenes to find all primes up to limit
        Dim isPrime() As Boolean = SieveOfEratosthenes(limit)
        
        ' Check each prime to see if it's also a palindrome
        For i As Long = 2 To limit - 1
            If isPrime(i) AndAlso IsPalindrome(i) Then
                sum += i
            End If
        Next
        
        Console.WriteLine($"Sum of all palindromic primes less than {limit}: {sum}")
        Console.ReadKey()
    End Sub
    
    ' Sieve of Eratosthenes to find all primes up to n
    Function SieveOfEratosthenes(n As Long) As Boolean()
        Dim isPrime(n) As Boolean
        For i As Long = 2 To n
            isPrime(i) = True
        Next
        
        isPrime(0) = False
        isPrime(1) = False
        
        Dim i As Long = 2
        While i * i <= n
            If isPrime(i) Then
                Dim j As Long = i * i
                While j <= n
                    isPrime(j) = False
                    j += i
                End While
            End If
            i += 1
        End While
        
        Return isPrime
    End Function
    
    ' Function to check if a number is palindrome
    Function IsPalindrome(n As Long) As Boolean
        Dim str As String = n.ToString()
        Dim len As Integer = str.Length
        
        For i As Integer = 0 To len \ 2
            If str(i) <> str(len - 1 - i) Then
                Return False
            End If
        Next
        
        Return True
    End Function
End Module
```
