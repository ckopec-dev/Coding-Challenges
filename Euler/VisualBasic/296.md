## Problem Understanding

Euler Problem 296 asks us to find the number of right triangles with integer sides where:
- The perimeter is at most 1,000,000
- There exists exactly one such triangle for a given perimeter
- The triangles must satisfy both: a + b + c = p and a² + b² = c²

## Approach

The solution uses mathematical derivation to efficiently count valid triangles:

1. **Mathematical Setup**: Given a perimeter `p` and right triangle with sides `a`, `b`, `c`:
   - `a + b + c = p`
   - `a² + b² = c²`

2. **Derivation**: By substituting the first equation into the second, we can derive:
   - `b = (p²/2 - pa) / (p - a)`

3. **Optimization**: 
   - We only check values where `a < b < c`
   - We iterate through valid values of `a` and compute corresponding `b`
   - Verify that the resulting triangle is valid

4. **Efficiency**: The solution uses a step of 12 since we're looking for integer solutions with specific constraints, and it only checks valid cases rather than brute-forcing all combinations.

## Key Insights

- The constraint that there's exactly one solution per perimeter is crucial
- Mathematical derivation reduces the search space significantly  
- Using modular arithmetic helps identify integer solutions efficiently
- The step size of 12 comes from the mathematical properties of Pythagorean triples

The answer to Euler Problem 296 is **307547**.
