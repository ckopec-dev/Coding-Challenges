# Euler Problem 430 Solution in Visual Basic

I'll solve Euler Problem 430, which involves finding the sum of the squares of the roots of a polynomial.

## Problem Statement
Euler Problem 430 asks us to find the sum of the squares of the roots of the polynomial:
$$P(x) = x^{1000} + x^{999} + x^{998} + \ldots + x^2 + x + 1$$

## Solution Approach

To find the sum of squares of the roots, I'll use the relationship between elementary symmetric polynomials and power sums. For a monic polynomial, if we know the coefficients, we can use Newton's identities.

Let's break this down:
1. The polynomial is $P(x) = \sum_{i=0}^{1000} x^i$
2. The roots are the 1000th roots of unity (excluding 1)
3. We need to find $\sum_{i=1}^{1000} r_i^2$ where $r_i$ are the roots

## Visual Basic Implementation

```vb
Module Euler430
    Sub Main()
        ' Euler Problem 430: Sum of squares of roots of polynomial
        ' P(x) = x^1000 + x^999 + ... + x + 1
        
        Dim n As Long = 1000
        Dim result As Double
        
        ' For the polynomial P(x) = x^n + x^(n-1) + ... + x + 1
        ' The roots are the nth roots of unity except 1
        ' Sum of squares of roots = (Sum of roots)^2 - 2 * Sum of products of roots taken 2 at a time
        
        ' Using Vieta's formulas for the polynomial P(x) = x^n + x^(n-1) + ... + x + 1:
        ' Sum of roots = -1 (coefficient of x^(n-1) divided by leading coefficient)
        ' Sum of products of roots taken 2 at a time = 0 (since there's no x^(n-2) term)
        ' But we need to be more careful with the actual polynomial
        
        ' For P(x) = x^n + x^(n-1) + ... + x + 1 = 0
        ' We can use the fact that sum of squares of roots = (sum of roots)^2 - 2 * (sum of products of roots taken 2 at a time)
        
        ' For our specific case, we can use the fact that the sum of squares of all nth roots of unity (including 1) is n
        ' But we exclude 1, so we need to subtract 1^2 = 1 from n
        
        ' Actually, let's think differently:
        ' The sum of squares of the roots of P(x) = x^n + x^(n-1) + ... + x + 1
        ' is equal to (sum of roots)^2 - 2 * (sum of products of roots taken 2 at a time)
        
        ' For the polynomial x^n + x^(n-1) + ... + x + 1:
        ' Sum of roots = -1 (coefficient of x^(n-1) = 1, leading coefficient = 1)
        ' Sum of products of roots taken 2 at a time = 0 (no x^(n-2) term, so coefficient is 0)
        
        ' But this is wrong because we have a different polynomial.
        ' Let's reconsider the problem properly.
        
        ' For P(x) = x^1000 + x^999 + ... + x + 1
        ' This is (x^1001 - 1)/(x - 1) for x ≠ 1
        ' The roots are the 1001st roots of unity except 1
        
        ' The sum of squares of all 1001st roots of unity (including 1) is 1001
        ' The sum of squares of the 1000 roots (excluding 1) is 1001 - 1^2 = 1000
        
        ' But let's use the correct mathematical approach:
        ' If P(x) = x^n + x^(n-1) + ... + x + 1, then P(x) = (x^(n+1) - 1)/(x - 1)
        ' The roots are the (n+1)th roots of unity except 1
        
        ' Using Newton's identities or direct computation:
        ' Sum of squares of roots = (sum of roots)^2 - 2 * (sum of products of roots taken 2 at a time)
        
        ' For P(x) = x^n + x^(n-1) + ... + x + 1, we have:
        ' Sum of roots = -1
        ' Sum of products of roots taken 2 at a time = 0 (coefficient of x^(n-2) is 0)
        ' But this is not right for the general case
        
        ' Let's use the correct mathematical approach:
        ' The polynomial P(x) = x^1000 + x^999 + ... + x + 1
        ' has roots that are 1001st roots of unity (except 1)
        
        ' For any polynomial P(x) = a_n*x^n + a_(n-1)*x^(n-1) + ... + a_1*x + a_0
        ' We can find sum of squares of roots using the formula:
        ' Sum of squares = (Sum of roots)^2 - 2 * (sum of products of roots taken 2 at a time)
        
        ' But there's a simpler approach:
        ' If P(x) = x^n + x^(n-1) + ... + x + 1, then P(x) = (x^(n+1) - 1)/(x - 1)
        ' The roots are the primitive (n+1)th roots of unity
        
        ' The sum of squares of all (n+1)th roots of unity = n+1
        ' The sum of squares of all n+1 roots except 1 = n+1 - 1 = n
        
        ' For n = 1000, the answer is 1000
        
        result = n
        
        Console.WriteLine("Euler Problem 430 Answer: " & result)
        Console.WriteLine("The sum of squares of the roots of x^1000 + x^999 + ... + x + 1 is " & result)
        
        Console.ReadKey()

## Mathematical Explanation

The solution relies on the properties of roots of unity:

1. The polynomial $P(x) = x^{1000} + x^{999} + \ldots + x + 1$ can be written as $\frac{x^{1001} - 1}{x - 1}$ for $x \neq 1$.

2. The roots of this polynomial are the 1001st roots of unity, excluding 1.

3. The sum of the squares of all 1001st roots of unity (including 1) equals 1001.

4. Since we exclude the root 1, we subtract $1^2 = 1$ from the total, giving us $1001 - 1 = 1000$.

## Final Answer

The sum of the squares of the roots of the polynomial $x^{1000} + x^{999} + \ldots + x + 1$ is **1000**.
