# Euler Problem 1 Solution in C#

## Problem Statement
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

## Solution

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        int sum = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < 1000; i++)
        {
            if (i % 3 == 0 || i % 5 == 0)
            {
                sum += i;
            }
        }
        
        Console.WriteLine($"The sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000 is: {sum}");
    }
}
```

## Alternative Solution using LINQ

```csharp
using System;
using System.Linq;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        int sum = Enumerable.Range(1, 999)
                           .Where(x => x % 3 == 0 || x % 5 == 0)
                           .Sum();
        
        Console.WriteLine($"The sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000 is: {sum}");
    }
}
```

## Mathematical Approach (Most Efficient)

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        int sum = SumOfMultiples(3, 999) + SumOfMultiples(5, 999) - SumOfMultiples(15, 999);
        Console.WriteLine($"The sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000 is: {sum}");
    }
    
    static int SumOfMultiples(int factor, int limit)
    {
        int count = limit / factor;
        return factor * count * (count + 1) / 2;
    }
}
```

## Output
```
The sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000 is: 233168
```

## Explanation

The first solution uses a simple loop to check each number from 1 to 999 and adds it to the sum if it's divisible by 3 or 5.

The second solution uses LINQ for a more functional approach, filtering numbers that are multiples of 3 or 5 and summing them.

The third solution uses the mathematical formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence, which is the most efficient approach with O(1) time complexity. It calculates:
- Sum of multiples of 3 below 1000
- Sum of multiples of 5 below 1000  
- Subtracts the sum of multiples of 15 below 1000 (to avoid double counting)

All three approaches yield the same answer: **233168**
