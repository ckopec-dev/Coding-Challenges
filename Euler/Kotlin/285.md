# Euler Problem 285 Solution in Kotlin

## Problem Statement
Consider the region enclosed by the circle x² + y² = 1. A square of side length 2 is centered at the origin. What is the probability that a point randomly selected from the square falls inside the circle?

## Mathematical Analysis
This is a classic geometric probability problem. We need to find the ratio of the area of the circle to the area of the square.

- Circle: x² + y² = 1 (radius = 1)
- Square: centered at origin with side length 2 (so it goes from -1 to 1 in both x and y directions)

Area of circle = π × r² = π × 1² = π
Area of square = side² = 2² = 4

Probability = Area of circle / Area of square = π/4

## Kotlin Solution

```kotlin
fun main() {
    // Calculate the exact probability
    val probability = kotlin.math.PI / 4.0
    
    println("The probability is: $probability")
    println("In decimal form: ${String.format("%.10f", probability)}")
    
    // Verify with a Monte Carlo simulation for accuracy
    val monteCarloResult = monteCarloSimulation(1_000_000)
    println("Monte Carlo approximation: $monteCarloResult")
}

fun monteCarloSimulation(iterations: Int): Double {
    var insideCircle = 0
    
    for (i in 1..iterations) {
        // Generate random point in the square [-1, 1] × [-1, 1]
        val x = kotlin.random.Random.nextDouble(-1.0, 1.0)
        val y = kotlin.random.Random.nextDouble(-1.0, 1.0)
        
        // Check if point is inside the circle x² + y² < 1
        if (x * x + y * y < 1.0) {
            insideCircle++
        }
    }
    
    return insideCircle.toDouble() / iterations
}
```

## Explanation

The exact mathematical solution is π/4, which is approximately 0.785398163.

The solution works as follows:

1. **Mathematical Approach**: 
   - The circle has radius 1, so its area is π
   - The square has side length 2, so its area is 4
   - Probability = π/4

2. **Monte Carlo Verification**:
   - Generate random points in the square [-1, 1] × [-1, 1]
   - Count how many fall inside the circle (x² + y² < 1)
   - The ratio approximates π/4

3. **Result**: 
   - Exact probability: π/4 ≈ 0.785398163
   - This represents the probability that a randomly chosen point in the square falls inside the unit circle

## Final Answer
The probability is **π/4** or approximately **0.785398163**.
