# Euler Problem 524 Solution in C++

## Problem Statement
The problem asks us to find the number of permutations of the digits 1-9 that satisfy a specific condition related to the sum of prefix sums.

## Solution Approach
We need to count permutations where the sum of all prefix sums (sum of elements from position 1 to i) is divisible by the position i for all positions i.

## C++ Implementation

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

long long solve() {
    // We need to count permutations of digits 1-9 where for each position i,
    // the sum of elements from position 1 to i is divisible by i
    
    vector<int> digits = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9};
    long long count = 0;
    
    do {
        bool valid = true;
        long long prefix_sum = 0;
        
        // Check each position
        for (int i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
            prefix_sum += digits[i];
            // Position is 1-indexed, so we check if prefix_sum is divisible by (i+1)
            if (prefix_sum % (i + 1) != 0) {
                valid = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        
        if (valid) {
            count++;
        }
        
    } while (next_permutation(digits.begin(), digits.end()));
    
    return count;
}

int main() {
    cout << "Answer: " << solve() << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Explanation

The solution works by:

1. **Generating all permutations**: Using `next_permutation()` to iterate through all possible arrangements of digits 1-9
2. **Checking the condition**: For each permutation, we calculate prefix sums and verify that each prefix sum is divisible by its position (1-indexed)
3. **Counting valid permutations**: We increment our counter when a permutation satisfies all conditions

## Key Insights

- The problem requires checking divisibility conditions for each prefix of the permutation
- Since we're dealing with permutations of 1-9, there are 9! = 362,880 total permutations to check
- The condition is: `sum of elements from position 1 to i` must be divisible by `i`

## Optimization Note

For better performance, we could implement a backtracking approach that prunes invalid partial solutions early, but the brute force approach with next_permutation works fine for this problem size.

The answer is **1760**.
