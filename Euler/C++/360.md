# Euler Problem 360 Solution in C++

## Problem Statement
Find the sum of all positive integers n ≤ 10^17 for which the equation x² + y² + z² = n has exactly 42 integral solutions.

## Mathematical Analysis

This is a problem about representing integers as sums of three squares. We need to find integers n where the number of representations as x² + y² + z² = n equals exactly 42.

Key insights:
- This involves the theory of ternary quadratic forms
- The number of representations is related to class numbers and theta functions
- For large n, we can use asymptotic formulas or direct computation for specific cases
