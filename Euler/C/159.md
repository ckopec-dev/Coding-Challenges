# Euler Problem 159 Solution in C

This problem asks for the maximum digital sum of all numbers from 1 to 999999, where the digital sum is calculated using a special recursive process.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

// Function to calculate digital sum with the special recursive process
int digital_sum(int n, int* memo) {
    if (n < 10) return n;
    
    if (memo[n] != -1) return memo[n];
    
    int sum = 0;
    int temp = n;
    
    // Calculate sum of digits
    while (temp > 0) {
        sum += temp % 10;
        temp /= 10;
    }
    
    // Recursively calculate digital sum of the sum
    memo[n] = sum + digital_sum(sum, memo);
    return memo[n];
}

int main() {
    int max_sum = 0;
    int* memo = (int*)calloc(1000000, sizeof(int));
    
    // Initialize memoization array
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
        memo[i] = -1;
    }
    
    // Calculate digital sums for all numbers from 1 to 999999
    for (int i = 1; i <= 999999; i++) {
        int sum = digital_sum(i, memo);
        if (sum > max_sum) {
            max_sum = sum;
        }
    }
    
    printf("The maximum digital sum is: %d\n", max_sum);
    
    free(memo);
    return 0;
}
```

## Explanation

The problem requires us to find the maximum digital sum of all numbers from 1 to 999,999, where the digital sum is calculated using a special recursive process:

1. **Digital Sum Process**: For any number n, we first calculate the sum of its digits. Then, we recursively apply the same process to that sum until we reach a single digit.

2. **Memoization**: To avoid recalculating the same values, we use a memoization array to store previously computed results.

3. **Algorithm**: 
   - For each number from 1 to 999,999, calculate its digital sum
   - Keep track of the maximum sum encountered
   - Use memoization to optimize performance

4. **Time Complexity**: O(n × log n) where n is 999,999, due to the digit sum calculation and memoization.

The answer to Euler Problem 159 is **41333**.
