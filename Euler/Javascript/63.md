# Euler Problem 63 Solution in JavaScript

## Problem Statement
The 5-digit number, 16807 = 7⁵, is also a fifth power. Similarly, the 9-digit number, 134217728 = 8⁹, is a ninth power.

How many n-digit positive integers exist which are also an nth power?

## Solution Approach
We need to find all numbers that are both:
1. An nth power (a^n)
2. Have exactly n digits

For a number a^n to have exactly n digits, it must satisfy:
- 10^(n-1) ≤ a^n < 10^n

This means we need to check for each n from 1 upward until no more valid numbers exist.

## JavaScript Implementation

```javascript
function solveEuler63() {
    let count = 0;
    let n = 1;
    
    while (true) {
        let found = false;
        
        // For each base a, check if a^n has exactly n digits
        for (let a = 1; a <= 9; a++) {
            const power = Math.pow(a, n);
            const digits = power.toString().length;
            
            if (digits === n) {
                count++;
                found = true;
            } else if (digits > n) {
                // Since a^n is increasing with a, if current a^n has more than n digits,
                // larger a values will also have more than n digits
                break;
            }
        }
        
        // If no valid numbers found for this n, we can stop
        if (!found) {
            break;
        }
        
        n++;
    }
    
    return count;
}

// Alternative approach - more mathematical
function solveEuler63Math() {
    let count = 0;
    
    // For each digit length n
    for (let n = 1; ; n++) {
        let found = false;
        
        // Check bases from 1 upward
        for (let a = 1; ; a++) {
            const power = Math.pow(a, n);
            const digitCount = power.toString().length;
            
            if (digitCount === n) {
                count++;
                found = true;
            } else if (digitCount > n) {
                // No more valid numbers for this n
                break;
            }
        }
        
        // If no valid numbers found for this n, stop
        if (!found) {
            break;
        }
    }
    
    return count;
}

// Run the solution
const result = solveEuler63();
console.log(`Answer: ${result}`);
```

## Explanation

The key insight is that we're looking for numbers where:
- The number equals a^n for some base a and exponent n
- The number has exactly n digits

For a number to have exactly n digits, it must satisfy:
- 10^(n-1) ≤ number < 10^n

So we need:
- 10^(n-1) ≤ a^n < 10^n

We iterate through possible values of n and for each n, we check bases a = 1, 2, 3, ... until we find that a^n has more than n digits, at which point we can stop checking larger bases for that n.

The solution stops when no valid numbers exist for a particular n value, which happens when a^n grows too large to have exactly n digits.

## Result
The answer is **49**.
