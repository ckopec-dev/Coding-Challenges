# Euler Problem 738 Solution

Let me solve this step by step.

First, I need to understand what Euler Problem 738 is asking for. Looking up the problem, it asks for the sum of all positive integers n ≤ 10^16 such that for every prime p dividing n, we have p² divides n.

This means we're looking for numbers where every prime factor appears at least twice in their prime factorization (i.e., n is divisible by the square of each of its prime factors).

Let me think about this systematically:

1. A number n is "square-full" if every prime in its factorization appears with exponent ≥ 2
2. We want to find all such numbers ≤ 10^16 and sum them

The key insight is that we need to consider numbers of the form n = p₁² × p₂² × ... × pₖ² × m² where m is square-free, but this is getting complex.

Actually, let me reframe this. If every prime factor appears at least twice, then n is a perfect square multiplied by a square-free number that's itself a perfect square? No, that's not right.

Let me think differently: if for every prime p dividing n, we have p² divides n, then n = p₁^(2a₁) × p₂^(2a₂) × ... × pₖ^(2aₖ) where each aᵢ ≥ 1. This means n is the square of a square-free number.

Wait, let me re-read this more carefully. 

If every prime p dividing n satisfies p² divides n, then we're looking for numbers that are divisible by the square of each of their prime factors.

Actually, this means we want numbers where all prime factors appear with exponents ≥ 2.

The most efficient approach is to generate all such numbers up to 10^16 by:
1. Generating all possible combinations of prime squares
2. Ensuring the product doesn't exceed 10^16

But there's a more elegant way: these are numbers of the form n = k² where k is square-free (or more precisely, numbers whose square-free part is square-free).

Let me reconsider - if every prime p dividing n satisfies p² divides n, then we're looking for numbers that are divisible by the square of each of their prime factors. This means n = p₁^(2a₁) × p₂^(2a₂) × ... × pₖ^(2aₖ) where aᵢ ≥ 1.

Let me approach this using inclusion-exclusion or generating function approach:

The numbers we want are those that are divisible by the square of each of their prime factors. These are exactly the numbers n such that n/p² divides n for every prime p dividing n, which means n/p² is an integer and p²|n.

Actually, let's think of it this way:
- For a number n = p₁^a₁ × p₂^a₂ × ... × pₖ^aₖ
- We require that for each i, we have aᵢ ≥ 2

So we're looking for numbers where all exponents in the prime factorization are at least 2.

This is equivalent to finding numbers of the form:
n = p₁^(2b₁) × p₂^(2b₂) × ... × pₖ^(2bₖ) where bᵢ ≥ 1

Or n = (p₁^b₁ × p₂^b₂ × ... × pₖ^bₖ)² where each bᵢ ≥ 1.

This is getting complicated. Let me approach it with a more systematic method:

The key insight is that we want all numbers such that for every prime p|n, p²|n.

Let's use a different approach:
- Generate all possible products of squares of primes
- Keep only those ≤ 10^16

But I need to be more careful about what the problem asks for. 

Looking at it again: For every prime p dividing n, we have p² divides n.

So we want numbers where every prime factor appears with exponent ≥ 2.

This is equivalent to saying that n = k² × m where k and m are positive integers and m is square-free (and this m should be 1, since we want all prime factors to appear with exponent ≥ 2).

Wait - no. If n = p₁^a₁ × p₂^a₂ × ... × pₖ^aₖ where aᵢ ≥ 2, then we can write this as:
n = (p₁^(a₁/2) × p₂^(a₂/2) × ... × pₖ^(aₖ/2))² × (p₁^(a₁%2) × p₂^(a₂%2) × ... × pₖ^(aₖ%2))

But since aᵢ ≥ 2, we have aᵢ%2 = 0 for all i.

So n is always a perfect square!

But that's wrong because we're not saying the exponents must be even. We're saying they must be ≥ 2.

Let me think of it this way:
If n = p₁^a₁ × p₂^a₂ × ... × pₖ^aₖ and for each i, aᵢ ≥ 2, then n is divisible by p₁² × p₂² × ... × pₖ².

So the numbers we want are those that are divisible by the square of all their prime factors.

The approach:
1. Generate all combinations of primes with exponents ≥ 2
2. Take products ≤ 10^16
3. Sum them
