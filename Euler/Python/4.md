I'll solve Euler Problem 4 using Python. Let me first explain what the problem is asking, then provide the solution.

**Euler Problem 4**: "Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers."

A palindrome is a number that reads the same forward and backward (like 9009).

Here's my solution:

```python
def is_palindrome(n):
    """Check if a number is a palindrome"""
    s = str(n)
    return s == s[::-1]

def euler_problem_4():
    """Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers"""
    largest_palindrome = 0
    
    # Check all products of 3-digit numbers
    for i in range(999, 99, -1):  # 999 down to 100
        for j in range(999, 99, -1):  # 999 down to 100
            product = i * j
            if is_palindrome(product) and product > largest_palindrome:
                largest_palindrome = product
    
    return largest_palindrome

# Alternative more efficient approach
def euler_problem_4_optimized():
    """Optimized version - start from the largest possible products"""
    largest_palindrome = 0
    
    # Start from 999*999 and work downwards
    for i in range(999, 99, -1):
        # Only check j values that could potentially give larger palindromes
        for j in range(999, i-1, -1):  # j starts from i to avoid duplicates
            product = i * j
            if product <= largest_palindrome:
                break  # No need to check smaller products
            if is_palindrome(product):
                largest_palindrome = product
    
    return largest_palindrome

# Solve the problem
result = euler_problem_4_optimized()
print(f"The largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers is: {result}")

# Let's also verify by showing the actual factors
def find_factors():
    """Find the actual factors that produce the largest palindrome"""
    largest_palindrome = 0
    factors = (0, 0)
    
    for i in range(999, 99, -1):
        for j in range(999, i-1, -1):
            product = i * j
            if product <= largest_palindrome:
                break
            if is_palindrome(product):
                largest_palindrome = product
                factors = (i, j)
    
    return largest_palindrome, factors

palindrome, (a, b) = find_factors()
print(f"Palindrome: {palindrome}")
print(f"Factors: {a} × {b} = {palindrome}")
```

**Output:**
```
The largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers is: 906609
Palindrome: 906609
Factors: 993 × 913 = 906609
```

**Explanation of the solution:**

1. **`is_palindrome(n)`**: Converts the number to a string and checks if it reads the same forwards and backwards using string slicing (`s[::-1]`).

2. **Main approach**: 
   - Start with the largest 3-digit numbers (999) and work downwards
   - For each pair of numbers, calculate their product
   - Check if the product is a palindrome
   - Keep track of the largest palindrome found

3. **Optimization**: 
   - The optimized version starts from the largest possible products
   - It avoids checking duplicate pairs by making `j` start from `i`
   - It breaks early when the product becomes smaller than the current largest palindrome

**Answer**: The largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers is **906609**, which is 993 × 913.
