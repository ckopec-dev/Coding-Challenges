# Euler Problem 2 Solution

## Problem Statement
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## Solution

```python
def euler_problem_2():
    # Initialize first two Fibonacci numbers
    a, b = 1, 2
    total_sum = 0
    
    # Generate Fibonacci sequence and sum even terms
    while a <= 4000000:
        if a % 2 == 0:
            total_sum += a
        a, b = b, a + b
    
    return total_sum

# Execute the solution
result = euler_problem_2()
print(f"The sum of even-valued Fibonacci terms not exceeding 4 million is: {result}")
```

## Alternative Approach (More Readable)

```python
def euler_problem_2_v2():
    # Generate Fibonacci sequence up to 4 million
    fib_sequence = []
    a, b = 1, 2
    
    while a <= 4000000:
        fib_sequence.append(a)
        a, b = b, a + b
    
    # Sum the even-valued terms
    return sum(x for x in fib_sequence if x % 2 == 0)

# Execute the solution
result = euler_problem_2_v2()
print(f"The sum of even-valued Fibonacci terms not exceeding 4 million is: {result}")
```

## Output
```
The sum of even-valued Fibonacci terms not exceeding 4 million is: 4613732
```

## Explanation

The solution works by:
1. Starting with the first two Fibonacci numbers (1 and 2)
2. Generating subsequent Fibonacci numbers by adding the previous two
3. Checking if each number is even and adding it to our running total
4. Stopping when we exceed 4 million
5. Returning the sum of all even-valued terms

The key insight is that in the Fibonacci sequence, every third number is even (following the pattern: odd, odd, even, odd, odd, even, ...), which could lead to further optimizations, but this straightforward approach is clear and efficient.
