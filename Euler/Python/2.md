I'll solve Euler Problem 2 using Python. This problem asks for the sum of even-valued terms in the Fibonacci sequence that don't exceed four million.

Here's my solution:

```python
def euler_problem_2():
    # Initialize first two Fibonacci numbers
    a, b = 1, 2
    total_sum = 0
    
    # Generate Fibonacci sequence and sum even numbers
    while a <= 4000000:
        if a % 2 == 0:
            total_sum += a
        a, b = b, a + b
    
    return total_sum

# Alternative more readable approach
def euler_problem_2_v2():
    # Generate Fibonacci sequence up to 4 million
    fib_sequence = []
    a, b = 1, 2
    
    while a <= 4000000:
        fib_sequence.append(a)
        a, b = b, a + b
    
    # Sum the even numbers
    return sum(x for x in fib_sequence if x % 2 == 0)

# Even more concise version
def euler_problem_2_v3():
    a, b = 1, 2
    total = 0
    
    while a <= 4000000:
        if a % 2 == 0:
            total += a
        a, b = b, a + b
    
    return total

# Run the solution
result = euler_problem_2()
print(f"The sum of even-valued Fibonacci terms not exceeding 4 million is: {result}")

# Let's also see the first few Fibonacci numbers to verify our approach
def show_fibonacci_sequence():
    a, b = 1, 2
    fib_list = []
    
    while a <= 4000000:
        fib_list.append(a)
        a, b = b, a + b
    
    print("First 10 Fibonacci numbers (≤ 4 million):")
    print(fib_list[:10])
    
    even_fibs = [x for x in fib_list if x % 2 == 0]
    print("Even Fibonacci numbers:")
    print(even_fibs)
    print(f"Sum of even Fibonacci numbers: {sum(even_fibs)}")

# Show the sequence
show_fibonacci_sequence()
```

**Output:**
```
The sum of even-valued Fibonacci terms not exceeding 4 million is: 4613732
First 10 Fibonacci numbers (≤ 4 million):
[1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
Even Fibonacci numbers:
[2, 8, 34, 144, 610, 2584, 10946, 46368, 196418, 832040, 3524578]
Sum of even Fibonacci numbers: 4613732
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Approach**: I generate the Fibonacci sequence iteratively, checking each number for evenness and adding it to our running sum.

2. **Key points**:
   - Start with Fibonacci numbers 1 and 2
   - Continue generating until we exceed 4 million
   - Only add even numbers to our total
   - Use tuple assignment `a, b = b, a + b` for efficient Fibonacci generation

3. **The sequence**: The even Fibonacci numbers not exceeding 4 million are: 2, 8, 34, 144, 610, 2584, 10946, 46368, 196418, 832040, 3524578

4. **Result**: The sum is **4,613,732**

The first solution (`euler_problem_2`) is the most efficient as it doesn't store the entire sequence in memory, just generates and processes each number on-the-fly.
