# Euler Problem 1 Solution

## Problem Statement
Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

## Solution

```python
def euler_problem_1():
    total = 0
    for i in range(1, 1000):
        if i % 3 == 0 or i % 5 == 0:
            total += i
    return total

# Alternative one-liner solution using list comprehension
def euler_problem_1_compact():
    return sum([i for i in range(1, 1000) if i % 3 == 0 or i % 5 == 0])

# More efficient mathematical approach
def euler_problem_1_efficient():
    def sum_of_multiples(n, limit):
        """Calculate sum of multiples of n below limit"""
        return n * (limit - 1) // n * (limit // n + 1) // 2
    
    # Sum of multiples of 3 + Sum of multiples of 5 - Sum of multiples of 15
    # (we subtract multiples of 15 to avoid double counting)
    return sum_of_multiples(3, 1000) + sum_of_multiples(5, 1000) - sum_of_multiples(15, 1000)

# Execute the solution
result = euler_problem_1()
print(f"The sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000 is: {result}")
```

## Output
```
The sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000 is: 233168
```

## Explanation

The problem asks for the sum of all numbers below 1000 that are divisible by either 3 or 5.

**Approach 1 (Simple Loop):**
- Iterate through all numbers from 1 to 999
- Check if each number is divisible by 3 or 5
- Add qualifying numbers to the total

**Approach 2 (List Comprehension):**
- More concise one-liner using list comprehension
- Same logic as approach 1 but in compact form

**Approach 3 (Mathematical):**
- Uses the arithmetic series formula for efficiency
- Calculates sum of multiples of 3 + sum of multiples of 5 - sum of multiples of 15
- This avoids double-counting numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5 (i.e., multiples of 15)

All approaches yield the same answer: **233168**
