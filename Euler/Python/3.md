I'll solve Euler Problem 3 using Python. First, let me state what the problem is asking:

**Problem 3**: What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143?

Here's my solution:

```python
def largest_prime_factor(n):
    """
    Find the largest prime factor of a given number n
    """
    # Start with the smallest prime factor
    factor = 2
    last_prime = 1
    
    while factor * factor <= n:
        # If factor divides n, it's a prime factor
        if n % factor == 0:
            last_prime = factor
            # Divide out all instances of this factor
            while n % factor == 0:
                n = n // factor
        factor += 1
    
    # If n is still greater than 1, then it's a prime factor
    if n > 1:
        last_prime = n
    
    return last_prime

# Solve the problem
number = 600851475143
result = largest_prime_factor(number)
print(f"The largest prime factor of {number} is: {result}")
```

**Alternative, more straightforward approach:**

```python
def is_prime(n):
    """Check if a number is prime"""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    if n == 2:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    
    # Check odd divisors up to sqrt(n)
    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def largest_prime_factor_simple(n):
    """Find largest prime factor using trial division"""
    largest = 1
    
    # Check all numbers from 2 to sqrt(n)
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            if is_prime(i):
                largest = max(largest, i)
            # Also check the corresponding factor n//i
            if is_prime(n // i):
                largest = max(largest, n // i)
    
    return largest

# Solve the problem
number = 600851475143
result = largest_prime_factor_simple(number)
print(f"The largest prime factor of {number} is: {result}")
```

**Most efficient approach (my first solution):**

```python
def largest_prime_factor(n):
    """
    Efficiently find the largest prime factor
    """
    factor = 2
    last_prime = 1
    
    while factor * factor <= n:
        if n % factor == 0:
            last_prime = factor
            # Remove all factors of 'factor' from n
            while n % factor == 0:
                n = n // factor
        factor += 1
    
    # If n > 1, then it's the largest prime factor
    if n > 1:
        last_prime = n
    
    return last_prime

# The answer to Euler Problem 3
number = 600851475143
answer = largest_prime_factor(number)
print(f"The largest prime factor of {number} is: {answer}")
```

**Output:**
```
The largest prime factor of 600851475143 is: 6857
```

**How it works:**

1. **Efficient Factorization**: Instead of checking every number, we only check up to √n
2. **Remove Factors**: When we find a factor, we divide it out completely to avoid checking composite factors
3. **Track Largest**: We keep track of the largest prime factor found
4. **Final Check**: If after all divisions n > 1, then n itself is the largest prime factor

The time complexity is O(√n) and this approach efficiently handles the large number 600851475143.
