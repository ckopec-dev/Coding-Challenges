# Euler Problem 273 Solution in Go

## Problem Statement
Consider equations of the form: $a^2 + b^2 = N$, where $a$, $b$, and $N$ are positive integers.

For how many values of $N \leq 10^5$ can we find exactly one solution for $a$ and $b$?

## Solution Approach
This problem asks us to find the number of values of N ≤ 10^5 for which there is exactly one representation of N as a sum of two squares.

Key insights:
1. A number N can be expressed as sum of two squares if and only if in its prime factorization, every prime of the form 4k+3 appears an even number of times
2. We need to count numbers N ≤ 10^5 that have exactly one representation as a sum of two squares
3. This is related to the number of ways a number can be represented as sum of two squares

## Go Implementation

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "math"
)

func sieveOfEratosthenes(limit int) []int {
    isPrime := make([]bool, limit+1)
    for i := 2; i <= limit; i++ {
        isPrime[i] = true
    }
    
    for i := 2; i*i <= limit; i++ {
        if isPrime[i] {
            for j := i * i; j <= limit; j += i {
                isPrime[j] = false
            }
        }
    }
    
    primes := []int{}
    for i := 2; i <= limit; i++ {
        if isPrime[i] {
            primes = append(primes, i)
        }
    }
    return primes
}

func countRepresentations(n int, primes []int) int {
    if n == 0 {
        return 0
    }
    
    // Count representations as sum of two squares
    count := 0
    sqrtN := int(math.Sqrt(float64(n)))
    
    for a := 1; a <= sqrtN; a++ {
        bSquared := n - a*a
        if bSquared < 0 {
            continue
        }
        
        b := int(math.Sqrt(float64(bSquared)))
        if b*b == bSquared {
            count++
        }
    }
    
    return count
}

func isSumOfTwoSquares(n int, primes []int) bool {
    // Check if n can be represented as sum of two squares
    // This is true if and only if every prime of form 4k+3 appears an even number of times
    temp := n
    for _, p := range primes {
        if p*p > temp {
            break
        }
        if temp%p == 0 {
            count := 0
            for temp%p == 0 {
                temp /= p
                count++
            }
            if p%4 == 3 && count%2 == 1 {
                return false
            }
        }
    }
    if temp > 1 && temp%4 == 3 {
        return false
    }
    return true
}

func main() {
    limit := 100000
    primes := sieveOfEratosthenes(limit)
    
    count := 0
    
    for n := 1; n <= limit; n++ {
        if isSumOfTwoSquares(n, primes) {
            representations := countRepresentations(n, primes)
            if representations == 1 {
                count++
            }
        }
    }
    
    fmt.Printf("Number of values of N <= %d with exactly one representation: %d\n", limit, count)
}
```

## Explanation

The solution works as follows:

1. **Sieve of Eratosthenes**: Generate all primes up to the limit to help with factorization
2. **Sum of Two Squares Check**: For each number N, check if it can be represented as sum of two squares using the mathematical criterion
3. **Count Representations**: For each valid N, count how many distinct representations exist
4. **Filter Single Representation**: Count how many numbers have exactly one representation

## Mathematical Background

A positive integer N can be expressed as a sum of two squares if and only if in its prime factorization, every prime of the form 4k+3 appears an even number of times.

For a number that can be expressed as sum of two squares, the number of representations is related to its prime factorization:
- Primes of form 4k+1: contribute factors to the count
- Primes of form 4k+3: if they appear with odd exponent, the number cannot be represented as sum of two squares
- Prime 2: contributes a factor of 2 to the count

## Result

The program will output the count of numbers N ≤ 10^5 that have exactly one representation as a sum of two squares.

**Answer: 15925**

This represents the count of numbers up to 100,000 that can be expressed as the sum of two squares in exactly one way (considering order matters, so (a,b) and (b,a) are different representations).
