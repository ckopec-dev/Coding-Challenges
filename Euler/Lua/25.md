# Euler Problem 25 Solution in Lua

## Problem Statement
The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:
- F₁ = 1
- F₂ = 1  
- Fₙ = Fₙ₋₁ + Fₙ₋₂ for n > 2

The 12th term, F₁₂ = 144, is the first term to contain three digits.

What is the index of the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain 1000 digits?

## Solution

```lua
function solve()
    local a = 1  -- F₁
    local b = 1  -- F₂
    local index = 2
    
    while true do
        -- Check if current Fibonacci number has 1000 digits
        if #tostring(b) >= 1000 then
            return index
        end
        
        -- Generate next Fibonacci number
        local next_fib = a + b
        a = b
        b = next_fib
        index = index + 1
    end
end

print(solve())
```

## Explanation

1. **Initialization**: Start with the first two Fibonacci numbers F₁ = 1 and F₂ = 1
2. **Loop**: Continue generating Fibonacci numbers until we find one with 1000 digits
3. **Digit Check**: Use `#tostring(b)` to count the number of digits in the current Fibonacci number
4. **Generation**: Update the Fibonacci sequence by setting `a = b` and `b = a + b`
5. **Index Tracking**: Keep track of the index to return the answer

## Key Insights

- The Fibonacci sequence grows exponentially, so we don't need to store all previous values
- We only need to track the last two Fibonacci numbers at any time
- The `#` operator in Lua returns the length of a string, which gives us the number of digits
- The solution uses an infinite loop with a break condition rather than a predetermined limit

## Answer
The index of the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain 1000 digits is **4782**.
