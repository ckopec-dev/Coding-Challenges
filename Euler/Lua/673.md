# Euler Problem 673 Solution in Lua

## Problem Statement
Euler Problem 673 asks us to find the number of ways to write a number n as a sum of distinct positive integers, where each integer is at most k.

## Solution Approach
I'll use dynamic programming to solve this problem. The approach is to build up solutions for smaller values and use them to construct solutions for larger values.

```lua
function euler673(n, k)
    -- Create a table to store the number of ways to represent each number
    local dp = {}
    
    -- Initialize dp array
    for i = 0, n do
        dp[i] = 0
    end
    
    -- Base case: there's one way to represent 0 (using no numbers)
    dp[0] = 1
    
    -- For each integer from 1 to k
    for i = 1, math.min(k, n) do
        -- Traverse backwards to avoid using updated values in the same iteration
        for j = n, i, -1 do
            -- Add the number of ways to form (j-i) to the current count
            dp[j] = dp[j] + dp[j - i]
        end
    end
    
    return dp[n]
end

-- Test with the actual problem values
print("Answer to Euler Problem 673:")
print(euler673(1000, 1000))
```

## Explanation

The solution uses dynamic programming with the following approach:

1. **Initialization**: Create a `dp` array where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to write the integer `i` as a sum of distinct positive integers.

2. **Base Case**: `dp[0] = 1` because there's exactly one way to represent 0 (using no integers).

3. **Iterative Process**: For each integer `i` from 1 to `k`:
   - Traverse the `dp` array backwards from `n` to `i`
   - For each position `j`, add `dp[j-i]` to `dp[j]`
   - This represents using integer `i` in the sum and adding all ways to form the remaining sum

4. **Result**: `dp[n]` contains the answer.

## Key Insights

- The algorithm ensures that each integer is used at most once (distinct integers)
- The backward traversal prevents using updated values in the same iteration
- The time complexity is O(n Ã— k) and space complexity is O(n)

## Verification

The algorithm correctly implements the mathematical principle of generating functions for partitions with distinct parts, where we count the number of partitions of n into distinct parts, each part being at most k.
