# Euler Problem 12 Solution in Ada

Euler Problem 12 asks for the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors.

A triangle number is defined as T(n) = n(n+1)/2, and we need to find the first such number with more than 500 divisors.

Here's the Ada solution:

```ada
with Ada.Text_IO; use Ada.Text_IO;
with Ada.Integer_Text_IO; use Ada.Integer_Text_IO;

procedure Euler_12 is
   
   function Count_Divisors(N : in Natural) return Natural is
      Count : Natural := 0;
      I     : Natural;
   begin
      I := 1;
      while I * I <= N loop
         if N mod I = 0 then
            if I * I = N then
               Count := Count + 1;  -- Perfect square case
            else
               Count := Count + 2;  -- Count both divisors
            end if;
         end if;
         I := I + 1;
      end loop;
      return Count;
   end Count_Divisors;
   
   Triangle_Number : Natural := 0;
   N               : Natural := 0;
   Divisors        : Natural;
   
begin
   loop
      N := N + 1;
      Triangle_Number := N * (N + 1) / 2;
      Divisors := Count_Divisors(Triangle_Number);
      
      if Divisors > 500 then
         Put("The first triangle number with over 500 divisors is: ");
         Put(Triangle_Number);
         New_Line;
         Put("It has ");
         Put(Divisors);
         Put(" divisors");
         New_Line;
         exit;
      end if;
   end loop;
end Euler_12;
```

## Explanation:

1. **Count_Divisors function**: This function efficiently counts the divisors of a number by only checking up to the square root. For each divisor `i` found, we also count `N/i` as a divisor (unless they're the same, which happens for perfect squares).

2. **Main loop**: We generate triangle numbers sequentially using the formula T(n) = n(n+1)/2, and for each one, we count its divisors.

3. **Optimization**: The divisor counting algorithm is optimized to only check up to √N, making it much more efficient than checking all numbers up to N.

The solution will output the first triangle number that has over 500 divisors, which is **76,576,500**.
